# WeatherAPI
## Goals: After some projects in my school, I realized my skills backend are still weak and have some limitations. These think stop at something like CRUD basic, implementing security with type Usernamepassword with spring security integrating with thymeleaf or with spring security providing JWT, implementing social login and I don't know how to cache API with the aim of optimizing performance of the system or implement oauth2 authentication. All of these reasons led me to do this project.
